Lasem aims to be a C/Gobject based SVG/Mathml renderer and editor, supporting CSS
style sheets (only rendering is implemented for now). It uses cairo and pango as
it's rendering abstraction layer, and then support numerous output formats: xlib,
PNG, SVG, PDF, PS, EPS...

The API tries to follow the SVG and MathML DOM.

It currently includes two simple applications:

lasem-render, which takes a filename as argument and generates either a SVG, a PDF
or a PS file, depending on the output file extension. There's a debug mode option
(-d) that displays the bounding boxes of elements as blue rectangles, the logical
extents of text as red boxes and the ink extents of text as green boxes. It accepts
either MathML, Latex maths and SVG input. For the latex input, lasemrender uses
the embedded itex2mml library for the conversion to MathML.

lsm-test, which, if launched without argument, renders recursively all svg and mml
files in a directory, and generate an html file which displays the browser
rendering, lasem rendering, and if present the reference output. The html
filename is lasemtest.xml. It's main use is the rendering of the sample files
in the samples directory, by invoking "cd test && ./lsm-test data".

Requirements:

gobject, glib, gio, gdk-pixbuf, gdk, cairo, pangocairo, libxml, bison, flex

For the runtime, the following ttf fonts should be installed: cmr10, cmmi10, cmex10 and cmsy10.
They are provided by the lyx-fonts package in fedora, and the ttf-lyx package in debian/ubuntu.
