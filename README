GMathml aims to be a C/Gobject based mathml renderer and editor, supporting CSS
style sheets. It uses cairo and pango as it's rendering abstraction layer, and
then support numerous output formats: xlib, PNG, SVG, PDF, PS, EPS...

The API tries to follow the MathML DOM.

It currently includes two simple applications:

gmathmlsvg, which takes a filename as argument and generates an SVG output
stored in gmathml.svg. There's a debug mode option (-d) that displays the
bounding boxes of elements as blue rectangles, the logical extents of text as
red boxes and the ink extents of text as green boxes.

gmathmltest, which, if launched without argument, renders recursively all mml
files in a directory, and generate an html file which displays the browser
rendering, gmathml rendering, and if present the reference output. The html
filename is gmathmltest.xml. It's main use if the rendering of the sample files
in the samples directory, by invoking "cd samples && ../src/gmathmltest".
