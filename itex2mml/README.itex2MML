itex2MML[1] transforms itex (a dialect of latex) into MathML.

Currently, we include itex2MML 1.3.5, without the following modifications:

  - a return value wasn't used, leading to a compilation warning in itex2MML.y ;
  - printf use is removed from itex2MML.y.

Some documentation can be found here [4].
